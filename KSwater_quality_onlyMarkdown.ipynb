    "# Exploring Water Quality Complaints\n",

    "I noticed a number of times during the winter that there was dark water flowing from our sink's faucet.  Not for very long, just a few seconds and usually when the water temperature was set to hot, but I hadn't noticed this at all in the summer.  I wondered if water complaints like this might be more common in the colder months, when there is presumably more damage to pipes from freezing weather.  I decided to try to find some water quality data for the city and explore it for possible seasonal fluctuations or geographic patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started by downloading the Water Complaints from NYC Open Data.  To work with the data, I decided to use Python 3 in a Jupyter notebook.  To begin, I wanted to visualize the data and answer a few basic questions about it.\n",

It looks like on average there are about 4 complaints per day, and that doesn't seem to be highly dependent on what time of year it is.  Perhaps it takes a really serious water problem to get New Yorkers to call in, and those don't happen seasonally.  Probably indicative of a well maintained water supply system!\n",

May also want to color points on lat/long plot to see if certain types of complaints come mainly from certain areas (also certain times is of interest).  Can probably use a dummy variable from the call notes for this.  Or without a dummy var, a nice way to do this with seaborn is shown here: \n",
