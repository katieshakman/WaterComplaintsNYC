Exploration of Water Complaints from an NYC Open Dataset

Exploring Water Quality Complaints
I noticed a number of times during the winter that there was dark water flowing from our sink's faucet. Not for very long, just a few seconds and usually when the water temperature was set to hot, but I hadn't noticed this at all in the summer. I wondered if water complaints like this might be more common in the colder months, when there is presumably more damage to pipes from freezing weather. I decided to try to find some water quality data for the city and explore it for possible seasonal fluctuations or other patterns.

I started by downloading the dataset as a csv. To work with the data, I decided to use Python 3 in a Jupyter notebook. To begin, I wanted to visualize the data and answer a few basic questions about it.

Water Complaints By Geographical Area
Question: Where are water quality complaints coming from in the city?

One way to visualize the complaints geographically is to plot a scatter of the complaints by location (latitude and longitude). Let's see if the incidents appear to cluster by latitude & longitude:

Water complaints plotted by latitude and longitude.
In [52]:
latlong_fig = plt.figure()
plt.plot(df['Longitude'], df['Latitude'], linestyle='', marker='o', markersize=0.5)
plt.xlabel('Longitude')
plt.ylabel('Latitude')
plt.title('Water Complaints by Location')
plt.show()

latlong_fig.savefig('by_location.png')

We can immediately see that the scattered data seem to come from all 5 boroughs: we can see the shapes of the Bronx and Manhattan (NW blob), Queens and Brooklyn (central/E blob, and SE strip corresponding to The Rockaways barrier islands), and Staten Island (SW).

We can color-code the map by borough to make it clearer which complaints come from which regions:

In [35]:
# fig = plt.gcf()
palplot = sns.palplot(sns.color_palette('Spectral',14));
fg = sns.FacetGrid(data=df.sort_values(by='Borough'), hue='Borough', size = 10, aspect=1.5)
mapped = fg.map(plt.plot, 'Longitude', 'Latitude',linestyle='', marker='o', markersize=5).add_legend()
context = sns.set_context("talk")
# fig.savefig('by_location_colorByBorough.png')
# fig = mapped.get_figure()
# plt.tight_layout()
# fig = palplot.get_figure()
# fig = fg.get_figure()
# fig = mapped.get_figure()
# fig = context.get_figure()
# fig.savefig('by_location_colorByBorough.png')
fg.savefig('by_location_colorByBorough.png', bbox_inches='tight')


We might want to see if any of these boroughs has dramatically more complaints than another.
To address that, we can start by getting the counts of complaints by borough, and visualizing them as a bar plot:

In [36]:
countplot = sns.countplot(y='Borough',
              data=df.sort_values(by='Borough'))
sns.set_context("talk")
fig = countplot.get_figure()
plt.tight_layout()
fig.savefig('complaint_count_byBorough.png')

We might wonder if certain areas are more prone to certain types of complaints. We can use the "Descriptor" column to color-code the datapoints and we get a map like this:

In [37]:
sns.palplot(sns.color_palette('Spectral',14));
fg = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, hue='Descriptor', 
                   hue_order=sorted(df['Descriptor'].unique()),
                   palette="Spectral", size = 10, aspect=1.5)
fg.map(plt.plot, 'Longitude', 'Latitude',linestyle='', marker='o', markersize=4).add_legend()
# plt.tight_layout()
fg.savefig('byLocation_ColorByDescriptorAll.png')


From this color-coded plot, it appears that Manhattan and nearby areas of Brooklyn and Queens have a high density of taste/odor complaints (bluer colors). However, it's hard to really see the breakdown just from this plot, given the high density of complaints in certain areas. We can break it down into subplots by borough:

In [38]:
countPlot = sns.countplot(y='Borough', hue = 'Descriptor', 
              data=df.sort_values(by='Descriptor'), 
              palette = sns.color_palette('Spectral',len(df['Descriptor'].unique())))
art = []
lgd = plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc=2, borderaxespad=0.)
art.append(lgd)
# sns.set_context("talk")
# plt.tight_layout()
fig = countPlot.get_figure()
fig.savefig('barByBorough_ColorByDescriptorAll.png', additional_artists=art,
    bbox_inches="tight")

If we only plot water complaints that sound similar to brown water, we get:
In [39]:
# Select the issue descriptions we want to plot:
partialDescList = [
 'Cloudy Or Milky Water (QB1)', 
 'Cloudy Or Milky, Other (Use Comments) (QBZ)', 
 'Oil, Grease In Water (QD1)', 
 'Other Water Problem (Use Comments) (QZZ)'
]

sns.countplot(y='Borough', hue = 'Descriptor', 
              data=df[df['Descriptor'].isin(partialDescList)].sort_values(by='Descriptor'), 
              palette = sns.color_palette('Spectral',len(partialDescList)))
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc=2, borderaxespad=0.)
sns.set_context("talk")

Seems like we see a good number of complaints in all boroughs, and definitely see barrier islands as well.
In [40]:
# Let's get a bar plot to see which areas have the most complaints. 
sns.countplot(y='Borough',
              data=df.sort_values(by='Borough'))
sns.set_context("talk")

plt.ylabel('Number of Complaints')
plt.xlabel('Borough')
sns.despine()

I wanted to normalize this to the population per borough, so I also downloaded NYC OpenData's census table as a csv.

After dividing each borough's complaints count by the 2010 census population for that borough (one could argue that a more recent population estimate would have been better, but the 2010 census should be an OK approximation), we get the updated bar plot:

In [46]:
sns.countplot(y='Borough',
              data=df.sort_values(by='Borough'))
sns.set_context("talk")
boroughComplaintsNormBy2010Pop
Out[46]:
BRONX            0.000775

QUEENS           0.001023
STATEN ISLAND    0.001645
dtype: float64

In [47]:
df['Borough'].unique()
Out[47]:
array(['BROOKLYN', 'MANHATTAN', 'BRONX', 'QUEENS', 'STATEN ISLAND'], dtype=object)
In [48]:
# Let's get a bar plot to see which areas have the most complaints, normalized by population.
xpos = sorted(df['Borough'].unique())
barplot = sns.barplot(x = xpos, y=boroughComplaintsNormBy2010Pop)

fig = barplot.get_figure()
plt.ylabel('Number of Complaints/Borough Population')
plt.xlabel('Borough')
plt.title('Number of Complaints by Borough, Normalized by 2010 Population')
plt.show()  
fig.savefig('NumComplaintsByBoroughNormBy2010Pop.png')

Now we can see that when we adjust for population, Staten Island has the most water quality complaints.

Water Complaints Over Time
Zooming in to see what's below those outliers:

Seeing what we get when we optimize a cosine function to fit the data from December 2013 to December 2016 (the latter half of the data, which seemed to have fewer outliers):

It looks like there is some periodicity, but it's not highly pronounced (the amplitude of our optimized curve is pretty low). It looks like on average there are about 4 complaints per day, and that doesn't seem to be highly dependent on what time of year it is. Perhaps it takes a really serious water problem to get New Yorkers to call in, and those don't happen seasonally. Probably indicative of a well maintained water supply system!

Note: Some of the calls were requests for information ("No sampling required..."), and these entries should be removed and the data reanalyzed. May also want to color points on lat/long plot to see if certain types of complaints come mainly from certain areas (also certain times is of interest). Can probably use a dummy variable from the call notes for this. Or without a dummy var, a nice way to do this with seaborn is shown here:

Future question: How does this periodicity (or lack thereof) compare to water quality at the beaches, which we might expect to be much more seasonal (due to e.g. increased growth of bacteria during warmer months).
